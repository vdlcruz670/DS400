```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

A - the new information were taking into consideration
B - the event we're calculcating probability for

Unconditional probability == prior probability == B

Likelihood
- L(B|A) = P(A|B)
- for the Likelihood calculation 
-- we want row because we want the B rows to equal to a 100%

P(B|A) == BAYES STAT

Adorning percentages by column == P(B|A) == same thing as getting our Bayes answer


We want that "given that" to equal 100, so in nhanes example, we wanted the B/diabetes to be 100
